# product-requirement-and-low-fidelity-wireframes
Background/Task:
A security product requires scanning container images and showing users the findings.  Container images contain applications with their dependencies and all these components might have known vulnerabilities.
Task:
Design a product that scans container images and shows vulnerabilities.
Deliverables:
Product Requirements Document
Low-fidelity wireframes (UI sketches)
(Optional) Development action items
âœ… To do (non-code):
Identify key user requirements:
View scan results (severity, vulnerability description)
Filter/sort by severity, date, or image name
Search large repositories
Draft product requirements (can help generate if needed)
Create wireframes (can be sketched or created with tools like Figma or Balsamiq)
